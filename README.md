 The project is a unique step forward in robotics, inspired by the natural behaviors of birds. Unlike many animal-inspired robots built for tasks like exploring underwater ortraversing difficult terrain, MandaBot is designed to closely replicate how birds move and communicate.
By mimicking birdsong and natural gestures, such as beak and tail movements,
MandaBot creates an environment where real birds can interact with it as if it were one of their own. This makes it a powerful tool for researchers who want to study how birds communicate, learn from one another, and adapt to their surroundings.
